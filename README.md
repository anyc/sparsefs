SparseFS
--------

FUSE client that creates a sparse view of an existing filesystem

Usage
-----

```
usage: ./sparsefs sourcedir mountpoint [options]

general options:
    -o opt,[opt...]        mount options
    -h   --help            print help
    -V   --version         print version

FilterFS options:
    -X, --exclude=pattern:[pattern...]    patterns for files to be excluded
    -I, --include=pattern:[pattern...]    patterns for files to be included
    --excludefile=filename                file with one exclude pattern in each line
    --includefile=filename                file with one include pattern in each line
    --default-exclude                     exclude unmatched items (default)
    --default-include                     include unmatched items
```

Include and exclude filters are specified on the command line or alternatively
in the system's fstab file with the following parameters:

```
  -I <pattern> OR --include=<pattern> OR -oinclude=<pattern>

  -X <pattern> OR --exclude=<pattern> OR -oexclude=<pattern>
```

The -o syntax takes the form of a mount option, which is needed to specify these
in the system fstab. In place of any of the <pattern> placeholders above
multiple patterns separated by colons can be used, yielding e.g.:

```
  -I <pattern>[:<pattern>[...]] or --exclude=<pattern>[:<pattern>[...]]
```

Additionally, these patterns can be specified in a file with one pattern per
line. Such a file can be passed to SparseFS with

```
  --includefile=<file> OR --excludefile=<file>
```

The default action for a FilterFS filesystem is to include all files that cannot
be matched by any rule. It is also possible to override this default behaviour
and exclude all unmatched files with the following parameter:

```
  --default-exclude
```

The order that rules are provided on the command line is the same as their order
in the filter chain.

It is also possible to mount FilterFS filesystems with the system's fstab file.
This would require an entry in /etc/fstab such as the following::

```
  #filterfs#/mnt/audio /mnt/filtered-audio fuse allow_other
  ,exclude=temporary*.log:*.cue,include=*.log:*.flac:*.mp3,default-include  0  0
```

Note that mounting FilterFS filesystems with the fstab file requires the
/sbin/mount.fuse utility from the fuse-utils package.

Building
--------

SparseFS only depends on the FUSE implementation. Make sure you have the
necessary files installed, e.g., by installing `libfuse-dev` on Debian-based
systems.

To build SparseFS, execute:

```
aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing
make
```
